# Cropify - Plant Disease Detection
Cropify, our innovative web-app utilizing machine learning, addresses the global threat posed by plant diseases to crop health and agricultural productivity. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to errors.
In response, machine learning algorithms automate the detection process by analyzing diverse imaging data, including leaf and hyperspectral images, with remarkable accuracy. Our project aims to harness this technology to develop a dependable system for early disease diagnosis and management. By
revolutionizing agricultural practices, Cropify endeavors to enhance global food
security.

## Overview

Cropify aims to address the critical need for efficient and accurate plant disease
detection in agriculture, which is vital for ensuring food security and increasing
crop yield. By leveraging cutting-edge technology such as machine learning and
computer vision, Cropify endeavors to revolutionize disease management
practices and empower farmers with timely and reliable diagnostic tools.
